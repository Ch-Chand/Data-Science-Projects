# Data-Science-Projects
This repo have almost all projects that I have done during my Data Science learning duration. I have used various kinds of algorithms of Machine Learning to do the predictions and after predictions, I have calculated the accuracy of each model.
Each Project is using a different dataset that can be found along with the code. And each project is having almost the following steps.
1) Data Understanding
2) Data Cleaning
3) Data Analysis (Descriptive, Statistic, EDA)
4) Feature Engineering
5) Model Building
6) Model Evalution
